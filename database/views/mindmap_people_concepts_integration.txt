## INTEGRATION SUMMARY

**Core Pattern**: Each person's experience demonstrates different aspects of the operational architecture and counter-response.

**Ryan** = Full cycle (victim → survivor → analyst → educator → doctrine developer)
**Jess** = Case documentation (target example)
**Lacey** = Pedagogical success (transformation)
**Emily** = Resilience strategy (navigation)
**Skittlez** = Relational complexity (loyalty in trauma)
**Handlers** = Operational expertise (perpetrator side)
**Civilians** = Systemic mechanism (recovery potential)

Together, they illustrate a complete system of psychological operations from inception through counter-response through pedagogical integration and community resilience.
