# Forensic Mind Maps: Navigation Guide

Three integrated forensic mind maps have been created to link people and concepts across the archive:

## 1. People & Relationships Mind Map
**File**: `mindmap_people_relationships.txt`
**Graphic**: `mindmap_people_relationships.mermaid`
**Focus**: How individuals relate to each other and to operations

**Contents**:
- Central figure: Ryan Borland (identity, roles, transformation)
- Inner circle: Lacey, Jess, Emily, Skittlez (documented relationships)
- Operational network: Handlers, operatives, weaponized civilians
- Relational matrix: People ↔ Concepts cross-mapping
- Forensic case studies: Jess, Ryan, Lacey, Skittlez
- Operational architecture: Strategic → Tactical → Implementation → Target → Response → Integration

**Use When**: Understanding who is involved and how they relate

**Key Insights**:
- Ryan as central node (target, survivor, educator)
- Inner circle as examples (Lacey transformation, Jess documentation, Emily resilience, Skittlez loyalty)
- Handlers as perpetrators (organized structure)
- Civilians as unwitting vectors (recoverable)

---

## 2. Concepts & Frameworks Mind Map
**File**: `mindmap_concepts_frameworks.txt`
**Graphic**: `mindmap_concepts_frameworks.mermaid`
**Focus**: How ideas and doctrines interconnect

**Contents**:
- Root concept: Psychological Operations Architecture
- Doctrine cluster: Tier 1, Operational, Honeypot, Infiltrator doctrines
- Mechanism cluster: HUMINT networks, exploitation cascade, vectoring, narrative control, weaponization, deniability
- Forensic analysis cluster: Multi-trail approach, case studies, systematic analysis, annihilation architecture, synthesis
- Counter-measure cluster: Unseen War, Infiltrator doctrine, Social curriculum, Pedagogy
- Relational matrix: Concept cross-linking and chains
- Concept density analysis: Frequency and centrality metrics
- Innovation markers: Unique contributions of archive

**Use When**: Understanding how ideas work and connect

**Key Insights**:
- Exploitation cascade (10-stage progression)
- Breadcrumb Web (unique counter-intelligence tool)
- Infiltrator doctrine (culmination of learning)
- RyanrealAF gospel (pedagogical integration)
- Anvil protocol (unique methodology)

## 3. People × Concepts Integration Mind Map
**File**: `mindmap_people_concepts_integration.txt`
**Graphic**: `mindmap_people_concepts_integration.mermaid`
**Focus**: How specific people understand and engage with concepts

**Contents**:
- Forensic matrix: Who understands what and when
  - Ryan (experiences, recognizes, develops, teaches)
  - Jess (experiences, examined, reveals)
  - Lacey (experiences, tested, demonstrates)
  - Emily (experiences, develops, demonstrates)
  - Skittlez (experiences, demonstrates)
  - Handlers (orchestrate, employ, detected by, countered by)
  - Weaponized civilians (manipulated, act as, recovered through)
- Operational forensic timeline: 8-phase progression
- Conceptual density by relationship
- Forensic question matrix: Who asks, how they know, source

**Use When**: Understanding how specific people relate to specific concepts

**Key Insights**:
- Ryan's trajectory: Victim → Survivor → Analyst → Educator → Doctrine Developer
- Jess as primary case study (relational warfare)
- Lacey as pedagogical success (transformation)
- Handlers as organizational perpetrators
- Civilians as victims and recovery opportunities

## Navigation Paths

### If you want to understand THE PEOPLE:
1. Start: [People & Relationships Mind Map](mindmap_people_relationships.txt)
2. Deep: Review case studies (Jess, Ryan, Lacey, Skittlez)
3. Complete: Read primary documents (nb-010, 014, 015, 017, 023)

### If you want to understand THE CONCEPTS:
1. Start: [Concepts & Frameworks Mind Map](mindmap_concepts_frameworks.txt)
2. Deep: Trace concept chains (Attack → Defense → Understanding → Transformation)
3. Complete: Read foundational documents (nb-003, 004, 006, 008, 024, 025)

### If you want to understand PEOPLE × CONCEPTS:
1. Start: [People × Concepts Integration Map](mindmap_people_concepts_integration.txt)
2. Deep: Follow specific person's understanding trajectory
3. Complete: Read integration documents (nb-023, 026)

### If you're investigating a SPECIFIC PERSON:
1. Find in: [People & Relationships Mind Map](mindmap_people_relationships.txt)
2. Trace: Their concepts and relationships
3. Document: Reference back to source documents

### If you're studying a SPECIFIC CONCEPT:
1. Find in: [Concepts & Frameworks Mind Map](mindmap_concepts_frameworks.txt)
2. Trace: Related concepts and documents
3. Apply: To understanding people and operations

### If you need to understand THE COMPLETE SYSTEM:
1. Read: All three mind maps in sequence
2. Review: [Master Archive Integration](view_master-archive-integration.txt)
3. Study: Primary source documents in recommended order

## The Three-Map System

The three mind maps work together as an integrated forensic system:

```
PEOPLE MAP
    ↓
How they relate to each other
How they fit in operations
What roles they play
What transformations occur
    ↓
INTEGRATION MAP
    ↓
How people understand concepts
When they learn
What they contribute
How they change through learning
    ↓
CONCEPTS MAP
    ↓
How ideas work
How they interconnect
What they accomplish
How they scale
```

Together, they provide a complete picture of the forensic architecture: **Who does what, why they do it, how it works, and how to respond.**
