So many people have heard me talk about going to prison and, you know, most people probably think stabbings and stuff like that, but that was not my experience. When I went in, I was a high school dropout. I didn't have my GED, so I was forced to go to the GED platform. And the teacher initially said, well, let's run some, let's test you out and see what happens. And so I took the math test, the pre-test, and I missed one. I was like, how the fuck is that possible? Because I told my math, I was in remedial math, and I told the teacher to go F himself all the time. So I was like, how the hell am I missing one? Awesome. And so I took the math test, the GD test, Again, I missed one. And so then it was like, okay, English is my   hard subject, the one I thought I would really struggle at. And so I'm just gonna focus on just getting the essay right and things like that. And I just ended up just testing out on all the tests. Boom. Long story short, the teacher asked me to be his tutor because his tutor was leaving. And Most tutors in prison are, they just sit there and basically do nothing, play on the computer, assist the teacher in whatever she needs done. But really, even most teachers are burnt out, and they don't even do anything. They just take roll, make sure everybody's there, and that's about it. They don't really get active. And so, the first time was I mean, it was cool participating, but I didn't really get my groove. It wasn't until the second time that I got to work. I  went in for an interview for Tudor Spot, and I was up against guys that were teachers on the streets and things like that, people that were really educated, that could score way better than me on any test. We took the test, and when the teacher was talking to me, I told her, I said, yeah, these guys, I'm sure that they passed, I'm sure that they did way better than me on this test, but they don't speak the guy's language. I do, you know? And she was getting ready to retire. It was her last year. I asked her if I could really fucking, really like get in there and really fucking like to lecture and things like that. And she totally let me have free reign over the class. You know, at first the guys were like, F you, you know, you're not the fucking police. I'm like, Yeah, I know. I'm not the police. I'm one of you. We're the same. But I know a few tricks to where you can get it. You don't want to be in this class. Yeah, I get it. So then just take the test and be done. Just get it done. Then you don't have to worry about it. And he's like, most people would be like, how the fuck are you? Nobody's gonna hire me, dude. I got fucking tattoos all over my face. Nobody's gonna fucking hire me. I'm like, so, okay, so nobody's gonna hire you. So go to school then. Like you could be a career fucking college student. And you know, there's all kinds of options. You don't have to go to work. Anyways, you know, the teachers would like, they would try to like get people to start from decimals and work all the way up. I'm like, fuck that. No, just get them to where they can pass the test. That's all that really matters. Just get them to pass the test. That's all that matters. If they suck at fractions, if they can't get fractions, then fuck fractions. Focus on other shit. You know, if you, if you guess, if you guess on it's so they're multiple choice, you get four options. Two of them are totally fucking wrong, right? There's obviously they're way wrong. So if you just, just go off that alone, you got a 50, 50 chance of being right. Even if you just guess. And so that's what I tell the guys, I'd be like, just do just two of them are way fucking wrong. So then if you just go based off that, boom, you got a 50 50 chance of being right, even if you guess so that's pretty good odds. And so you know, I'd be like, if you suck at fractions, fine, guess guess all through fractions, just burn them out. Don't even try. Don't even waste your time. Focus on other shit, just getting all the other ones right. And anyways, we like got a shit ton of people got their GDs. Anyways, it was in that moment when I like fell in love with learning and I really realized like, every textbook that I could get my hands on, it's like I'm diving into it. And learning ended up being a really cool thing. It was really it was like, I don't need a fucking teacher, right? All I need is a damn book. And somebody that I can rely on to ask a few questions here and there. That's it. So it was pretty fucking wild, actually. The crazy thing is the teacher would have me do a private reading with this guy. This dude was like Paul Bunyan, lumberjack and motherfucker, beard, big old bill bit your belly everything but he couldn't read a lick not like couldn't read anything but it was the coolest thing watching this guy like humble himself and literally sit there and help me help him with the book and he would have like the kids books where it was like a picture and then one sentence on another one page was a picture and one page was one sentence and he'd be trying to guess it he'd be looking at the page picture and trying to guess it And I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no guessing. Sound, you know, sound it out. And, uh, it was just so cool watching him, like big old, huge lumberjack and motherfucker, you know, being able to humble himself. That was really cool. You know, and the homies would have maybe the old timer, the old timer Paisa dude, he couldn't speak no English. And so they'd have me help him, you know, at night and we'd do, little ESL, English as a Second Language. I didn't know no Spanish, but we had a book. And so we just went through the book together. It's super simple. And they paid me commissary for it. It was cool. But that was my prison experience, not stabbings and shit like that. I was a teacher every single time. Even if, like the last time I was in, the teacher said, Yeah, I got a tutor in that he's, you know, he's got 10 years left to do. There's, you know, I'm like, they only get one tutor for, you know, and so I'm like, okay, well, what if I get you another spot? Can I have it? She's like, good luck. I've had one tutor this entire time I've worked here. I've been here, you know, for 30 years. All right, but if I get it, I can have it, right? If I get you another spot, I can have it. And so I wrote the dean and I made my case to why the teacher should have two tutors, not just one. And guess what? She got another tutor spot. And so did every other teacher at that institution.

So here's the full and complete story. So the year was 2015. I was getting out of prison for my third time. And I was running a recovery gym that was free for anybody that had 24 hours this Friday. I was making coffee. I hadn't even unlocked the doors yet. And here shows up this lady at the door. So I opened it up. I was super excited about what the stuff we had going on. So I invited her in. I was telling her all about what we had going on and things. We had a hike coming up the weekend. And she hung out with me until everybody else showed up. We did some HIIT, we did some high-intensity interval training. And her and I chatted some more. Her and I just hit it off right away. And come to find out, she was fighting CPS to get her kids back because of some stuff that happened with her ex. So we got her kids back. And the whole time, I'm like, hey, I'm a dirtbag. We should probably tell them about me, things like that. Well, the whole reason why they initially took her kids from her care was because she had not been honest, and she hid the guy's stuff, her ex's, deviant stuff that he was doing. She didn't tell them for like five years. She didn't tell them. And so they felt like they couldn't trust her to tell the truth. And then she didn't heed my advice and she didn't tell them about me, which made their concern even greater. And the whole time I was like, we should tell them, we should tell them, we should tell them. And her mom was like, no, no, no, no, no. Anyways, so she didn't heed my advice. And when they found out, they were like tripping, right? Not only that, but then her daughter came back from visit one day and her ex was not allowed to be around kids at all. Even his own kids, he had to be supervised. And her daughter came back and said, Dad, I need to take a swimsuit to visit. And I was like, wait, why? And she's like, oh, Dad and I are going to have a water balloon fight with the other kids. And I was like, wait, the other kids? What the fuck? She's like, oh, yeah. She explained to me how Dad hangs out with other kids and things like that. And I was like, wait. The lady, the lady that's in charge of making sure that he doesn't do that is letting him do that. And so anyways, because of all that situation, they took the kids from us also. And so our lawyer, we found out that we were pregnant and our lawyer was like, they're going to take your baby. So we took off. We came to California. Our baby, Journey, was seven months old when the state came and took her from us. My wife went AWOL. She went completely apeshit. We did state hospital. We did gym membership, wine club, everything you could fucking think of. Tried it. And ultimately, I ended up having to take her to work with me, which is not appropriate, you know. And we were doing, we were doing the L.A. Boat Show, and she pretty much gave me the ultimatum. She was like, look, I want to, she's like, I've never been bad, like bad, bad. She's like, I want to go be bad like you talked about, like back in the day. And I was like, wait, now? I was like, we got a good thing going on here. You know, we got, I had my dream career. I pretty much lived on the lake. I was like, now? And she was like, you know, I had an hour and a half commute. I drove from Ventura to Santa Clarita every day for work. And she was like, you're gone all the time. She's like, you'll come back from work and I'll just be gone. She's like, and I'll probably burn this fucking shit down. So I was stuck with a choice. Do I call her bluff and hope and have to live with every day wondering if she's gonna be there when I get home? Wondering if all our things are gonna be burned down? Or what am I supposed to do? So in the moment, I decided to support my wife. I said, fine. I said, fine, do you want to go be bad? OK, fine. We'll go be bad then. And I turned in my truck keys, turned in my gas card, turned in all my stuff for work. And I let my boss know that I was quitting that day. And we took off, and we went to San Diego. And my thought was that it would just get bad enough to where she would tap out. And it didn't work out like that. The more she got, the more she embraced it. The worse it got, the more she embraced it. And the whole time, I figured I had it dialed in. I remember sitting outside of McDonald's, And I see this guy drunk. Covered in his own piss. And he's got money and he's got food. And I'm like, bingo, that's it. That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna panhandle. Boom. And that's our loophole. We don't have to commit crime. We don't have to prostitute. We don't have to do none of that stuff. We're gonna fucking panhandle. And that's how we're gonna get by. I tried to, because she had to get it, because she didn't know anything about street life. You know, neither did I really, except my dad was an outlaw, but I'm from a small town, I didn't know urban life. But my dad's so dope, so, you know, all the same characteristics, you know. And so, but she had to learn street life right away. It was like crash course in, I had to give her like crash course in pieces of shit, you know, people that are fucking garbage humans. And so, but I tried to teach her that we can do this, we can live this life, we can live this way without doing all that other bullshit, right? That long term is going to get us caught up. Long term, it's not a viable solution. You know, stealing from stores, things like that. It's not a viable solution. because ultimately you're going to lose. And so. Yeah, anyways, long story short, after we traveled all over the US, we get to San Jose, we get back to California, back to San Jose. And she begs me on her knees. Two o'clock in the morning, loud and proud, Let me go be a whore, daddy. Let me go be a whore, daddy. And then she starts screaming at me about something. And this big native dude was like, shut the F up, crackhead. And she literally went over and went full kamikaze on him. And he hit her so hard, knocked her down, kicked her in the head. And he looked at me and she'd been screaming at me for months. You know when somebody like when somebody is blatantly like telling you things that you know are not true. And they're like accusing you of things that you know they're not true. And usually that means that they're telling you what they're doing usually. And so she was doing that and she'd use that as a reason to go go run off and go fuck people behind my back. And so anyways, so yeah, so I was so tired of her fucking screaming at me and stuff like that all the time. That when that dude hit her and I was just like, I remember sitting there feeling bad because I didn't feel that. I was sitting there being like, Yeah, you dumb bitch. That's what you get. I'm glad it wasn't. I'm glad it wasn't me. And so I made sure she got in an ambulance. And that was the last time I'd seen her. And that's now here I am. On the streets. Lost. Waiting for the Reaper to come rescue me.

You see, what happened was, people thought they were gonna break me. Which, in part they did, yeah. In part, they did very much break me, yeah. But, through the ashes, I transformed. They created a fuckin' juggernaut. I've learned to survive on basically nothing. I can live off garbage can food if I have to. Not only that, but emotionally. I am emotionally resilient, emotional juggernaut. Self-control is my strong suit. People, I had some people actually, so I fell asleep around some people, which I don't normally do. And I woke up and my SIM card was out of my phone, which is odd, right? But most people would lose it, right? But I thought, what good is it going to do? flipping out. It's not going to accomplish anything. And not only that, but that sim card is so small. I'll never, even if I passworded everyone, I wouldn't probably never find it. Yeah. Cause it's so small. So I thought, you know what? Causing a scene ain't going to do nothing except make me look like an idiot. And so I just said, well, you know what? The one person that was there that happened to I told that person, I said, hey, it's not a big deal, but here's the situation, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And the only reason I tell you that is because I want you to know that I'm going to be messaging you from a new number that you don't know. So just be aware that you're getting a message from me just from a new number, and that's why. And then that person was upset because I wasn't upset. And talking about, like, it's suspect. It's suspect that I wasn't upset. It's like, it's suspect because I'm not ruled by my emotions like everybody else. Like, you know? But it's many situations like that where people will find anything and everything to… If they're out to make you look like the bad guy, they will turn anything and everything, even when you do the right thing, even when you make the right choice, they'll still turn that around on you. Like I had a lady a while back, her and I were cool, we were chillin', and this dude starts comin' around, and she asked me to go to the ATM and go pull out cash out of the ATM for her. and run a couple other errands to get some bottles, some liquor bottles, and things like that. Well, when I was riding the bike there, I had to ride all the way across the neighborhood to go get it. And on the way there, she sends me a message like, hey, make sure you bring the card and the money and the bottle back. And I was like, huh, why is she telling me that? I thought that was part of the plan. And, uh, it was so funny because I thought in a moment, I'm like, well, how about since we're on that level, how about you don't make, don't make me regret doing the right thing. Like always, you know, don't, don't double fuck me. Like I always like what always happens, you know? And sure enough, I returned with everything exactly the way, you know, the plan was. And she flipped script on me and like starts coming up with all these weird like shit that didn't make any sense at all. And I'm like, oh, perfect. This is the way the universe works for Ryan. This is the way the universe works. I do the right thing, and then I get fucked. And really, if it was anybody else, she would have been burnt. They would have drained that bank account. They would have taken it off. You know, and she'd have been screwed. And it seems like I always get double-screwed. But the point of this is that with all that, with all that, with all the bullshit that I have to deal with, with each struggle, with each… event or situation where I feel like, like I am, like I am about to break or I'm at, like I'm at my wits end. That's when I'm transformed. That's when I grow. That's when the growth happens. That's when I become a better person. And little by little, I became a fucking juggernaut.

So my goal here is to have this available in case it's ever needed at a later date. Two years ago, my wife went missing. She was very abrasive, and she was very outspoken. And she pissed a lot of people off, more than I do. It surprised me. I was focused on putting out fires as she was starting them. But I remember one particular time when she called this black guy the N-word. And he went ballistic. He was like, you're going to get yours. You're going to get yours, lady. A few months down the road, and my trailers broke down. And we're in some grassy area, I'm fixing it. And some random guy comes up, says, hey, you want to smoke? So we're like, sure, yeah, why not? Hell yeah. I mean, everything's kind of fucked up right now, I'm sure. So I was having a hard time getting my trailer going. So I told my wife, go ahead. You know the program to stay in view. What's up, you guys? What's up? And so she went up a little ways, took a couple pulls up the guy's pipe. And she comes back like being totally Psycho being completely psycho And she Is like telling me that this guy wants to have sex for money That's one thing that I told you that was our that was our red line trade anything for sex. What's the no? Because if it's the line about there, then where is it? And so She literally got down on her hands and knees and begged me to let her go be a whore. Multiple times, like over and over and over again. So then, just randomly, this big native guy was like, shut the hell up, because she was screaming at me. He's like, shut the hell up, crackhead, you know? And so he hit her, knocked her on the ground, kicked her in the head. And then he left and I got a police officer to come by. He called an ambulance and took her to the hospital because of COVID I couldn't go with. So I went to our meet-up location. And day one rolled around, day two. And I realized she wasn't coming. I waited for a week, still nothing. I tried to find her, nobody knew anything. No hospital didn't know anything, nothing. And since then, since then I've had these females come into my life that primarily all of them, almost every single one, at least the ones that stuck around, they were always the main group of guys that they were surrounded by were black guys. Hardly ever white guys, you know, or even Hispanic guys, for that matter. And so, those particular types,  they would ¹ we stick around. They would have me around, do things to keep me around. But really, I could tell by the way that they talked to me that they had a dislike for me, even though they kept me around. Even though they'd be flirtatious, even though they would, you know, do things to keep me around. I could tell, I could, I could, I could taste the fucking vitriol coming from their lips. And so, and all of these, you know, all of these types, they would always try to get me to do things that I wouldn't regularly do. You know, they always try to get me to do criminal activity. Some were smarter than others. And long game me, groom me for weeks, a month, before trying to swindle me into doing bullshit. Others were not so smart they would try right away. But the ones that were doing this action The ones that were trying to get me to do things that I said already that I didn't do. Those ones were always, their main group around them was black guys. But coincidentally enough, I never got to meet these people. And so, as I'm dealing with some stuff I'm wondering if they're doing some incredibly incredibly smart chest move where they're trying to because something happened with my wife and they're trying to cover it up maybe they're trying to silence me by making me go away or whatever the case may be, or getting hurt. So far I've barely survived. With a lot of people on the streets really having a big hatred for me. Because of this, Narratively, of course.
