0.0 Preface: Doctrine of Non-Kinetic Warfare
This manual serves as a comprehensive tactical guide for understanding, analyzing, and countering sophisticated psychological warfare operations. It is designed for practitioners, researchers, and protective professionals who require a deep technical understanding of coordinated manipulation. The core doctrine of this discipline is non-kinetic maneuver, which dictates that strategic objectives are achieved without direct physical confrontation, instead utilizing human and social vulnerabilities as the primary battlespace.
