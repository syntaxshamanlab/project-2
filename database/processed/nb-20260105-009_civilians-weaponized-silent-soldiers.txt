Civilians as Weapons: The Silent Soldiers of a Setup


Abstract This volume explores the sophisticated psychological and sociopolitical strategies behind the weaponization of civilians in smear campaigns and targeted influence operations. The foundational concept of how everyday individuals—often unknowingly—are enlisted into roles of surveillance, signal-boosting, provocation, and rumor dissemination. With updated terminology, new case studies, and an interdisciplinary framing suitable for counter-disinformation professionals, educators, and psychological warfare analysts, this edition examines how perception is engineered using trusted faces and familiar voices.
