The Social Test: A Narrative of Manipulation and Survival
The Initial Setup: People Pulling into My Orbit
The story begins with a series of seemingly coincidental encounters. A friend, Skittlez, insisted on me meeting her friend, Gina. As time went on, people would enter my life in different cities, all with a similar pattern. Gina's boyfriend would show up with a bike for me, or a similar orange bike would appear elsewhere. I was given a hat, only to see her boyfriend wearing the same one. The intent of these people seemed clear: they were trying to learn my mannerisms and habits, but they made no real effort to hide it.


The First Test: San Diego
The true nature of these interactions became clear early on with an incident in San Diego. A woman gave me her debit card and asked me to run an errand for her, returning with bottles and the cash. Halfway through the task, she sent a text, reminding me to bring back everything. I was offended, as I believed we were on the same team, and loyalty shouldn't have to be requested. When I returned with everything exactly as she asked, she was inexplicably mad. It dawned on me then that the point wasn't for me to succeed, but to fail. I was being set up to take the money so that it would fit a predetermined narrative.


This became a recurring theme. People would leave me in situations with money or valuables and then be furious when I didn't steal them. I was being tested, and my honesty was met with anger because it didn't align with the story they were trying to push about me.
You know but here's the thing on countless occasions I would meet some people and maybe a couple and during our relationship they would have a fight and the girlfriend would come tell me things like and she be referencing her boyfriend being extremely nice to me providing me with you know drugs she would say “you know people are not that nice right?” Give me that look, you know that look that says come on man. My response “what are you talking about?” Then she'd reply “people don't just give away drugs” and in the moment I truly thought he just liked me.
This transitioned from a random person being nice to a handler that was positioned to check in on me and make sure I was fed but not with food and if they could get me to fall asleep around them so they could hack my phone. This one particular handler Mike (the nicest of them all) I woke up one morning and noticed something weird on his phone an MS Dos type screen. Which I didn't notice was the same as mine which I had just lost my old one and so I switched from a Motorola to a Samsung and coincidentally at the same time he had to switch also because he (lost his and the store didn't have any Motorolas). 


The Campaign Against Me and the Consequence
This pattern escalated. A campaign began to pigeonhole me, with people in the community spreading rumors. The effect was immediate and devastating: donations from the American people, my main source of income and my "buffer" from trouble, stopped completely. I was forced to rely on eating out of the trash. I held my ground, remaining sober and miserable, going to bed hungry rather than stealing. This was a commitment I had made after a victim-empathy class in prison, where I learned how crime affects people long after the act.


The campaign had succeeded. The only people willing to help me now were the very ones who had been trying to set me up, who had been "working diligently to get to that point." I was now in a position where I had to choose between starving and accepting help from those who wished to see me fail.


The Escalation: The Shopping Cart and the Threat
For a year, I managed to walk this line, telling new "groomers" up front that I wouldn't participate in their illegal activities. I would play defense, waiting for them to act, refusing to be involved. This went on until one day, a woman went into a store, came back out, and demanded I go in and steal a shopping cart full of groceries. I refused, reminding her of my policy. She started screaming, making a public scene. It wasn't about the groceries; it was about forcing me to do what they wanted.


When I still refused, the situation changed entirely. She threatened me, saying, "You either go get it or the homies gonna deal with you, dude." The game of manipulation and bribery was over. My life was now being threatened.


The Tactic and the Aftermath
I was public enemy number one for not doing something bad they wanted me to do. After some research, I found that these were "textbook South American tactics"—a systematic way to manipulate and trap people.


Before all this, I had already begun developing a strategy for survival, like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs. I knew I wasn't going "back home," and I knew I couldn't win the campaign against me. I had seen them throw everything at me—threats, bribes, lies—and I thought I had the upper hand when the lies started. I believed people would see through it.


But they didn't. The American people "bought it," and my support vanished. The streets, however, never failed to provide drugs. The one thing I needed most—food—was withheld, but the one thing that could lead to my downfall was always available.
