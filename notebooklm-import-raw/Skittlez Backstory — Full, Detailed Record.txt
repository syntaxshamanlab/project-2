Skittlez Backstory — Full, Detailed Record


1) First contact and location


You were new to Santa Barbara and met a man who said he could “get something.”


He took you to an abandoned apartment complex (approx. 8–10 vacated units).


His personal space was a small under-the-stairs nook (you described it as “Harry Potter under the stairwell”).


He said “my person is asleep; we’ll wait”—no gender given, which led you to think the plug might be a woman.




2) Meeting her; who was present


You went to one of the abandoned units where the plug (skittlez) was staying.


Skittlez best friend Emily was there
(Emily and I more than a year later started our poetic colab. The what if series)


The guy you’d arrived with began talking and hanging out with the plug’s friend; they eventually fell asleep.




3) Your setup, shower scene, and initial approach


The plug told you: you could chill in the other room, plug in your stuff, and work on your projects (you mentioned your videos/content).


She later said she was going to shower and lingered: door open at times, moving in and out; you took that as a possible nonverbal invite.


You asked: “You want some company?”


She answered: “I have a boyfriend.” The tone read as a soft no or a test (not definitive).


You responded: “I give really good back rubs.”


She replied: “You had me at back rub.”




4) Ongoing dynamic: your role and her “ritual”


You state that, in general with women you know across California, you “rank below the dog” on the hierarchy (i.e., not calling shots, often supporting roles).


With her specifically:


She had a specific ritual to get high that required:


1. Your help, and




2. Her vibrator operating.






If those conditions weren’t met, she considered the session “wasted.”


This created significant pressure on you; when she later wanted sex, you sometimes froze due to the expectation and pressure.




You emphasize this was not an equal dynamic; you often felt like a tool/helper rather than a chosen partner.




5) “Get out” incident when her boyfriend’s release neared


During an intimate moment (you describe straddling her with the vibrator on), she suddenly told you: “Get out.”


You asked “What? Now?” She repeated “Get. Out.”


You interpreted this shift as coinciding with her boyfriend’s upcoming release from prison and respected that boundary, though it hurt.




6) Acts of loyalty / showing up for her (multiple incidents)


Montecito tent incident:


She called late at night saying: “I think there’s someone outside my tent.”


You had no bike/ride and moved on foot from Goleta to Montecito—running/jogging/power-walking to reach her.




Hospital in Los Angeles:


She was hospitalized in L.A. while you were in Santa Barbara.


You dropped everything to go so she wouldn’t be alone.


En route you broke your collarbone but still rode a pedal bike (half the distance) despite severe pain (you noted your lips were quivering from the pain).




“I need you ASAP” while you were in L.A.:


You had no money and no bus pass.


Options you considered:


1. Beg a ride from a bus driver and try to get to Union Station and hope for help; or




2. Bus to Santa Monica → bus to Malibu → walk from Malibu to Oxnard (then bus to Santa Barbara).






You chose option 2 and walked ~16 hours from Malibu to Oxnard, then bused to Santa Barbara—with no food, no sleep—motivated solely by her request for help.


You describe Point Mugu as a key marker; by then you were on pure willpower, repeating “one more step / one more rep” for hours.




Bike emergency (“don’t stash your stuff”):


On another day she said she needed to stash her belongings because her bike broke.


You told her not to stash, sourced someone’s bike (you say you gave up almost everything you had to get it), and brought it so she could keep moving.


After helping, you felt she treated you as an inconvenience.






7) Your reflection on the relationship


You describe this bond as not traditional love and not standard friendship—more like “trauma twins” navigating chaos.


You were often the safety net, not the chosen partner—trusted but not chosen.


You believe she saw all of you and didn’t flinch, and—even when she sent you away—she knew you’d come back, and she was right.

Skittlez: The Origin Story (Emilys)
RyanrealAF’s tale of loyalty, blurred lines, and the weight of the unspoken


[Scene 1: The Abandoned Complex]
I was fresh to Santa Barbara, just getting my bearings when I met this dude. Seemed cool enough. I asked if he could get something. He said, “No problem. Let’s go to my spot.”


His spot? A straight-up ghost town of a building—8 to 10 abandoned units. We ducked into what looked like a leftover set from a post-apocalyptic flick. His little nook? Some Harry Potter under-the-stairs setup.


He said, “My person’s asleep (skittlez). We’ll chill ‘til they’re up.”
Didn’t say he, didn’t say she—just “person.” I’m thinking, the plug might be a chick. So I play it cool, not trying to spook the vibe.


Turns out I was right.


We get to one of the empty units. Inside? A woman—quiet, lowkey. Her friend’s there too. (Emily) The dude I came with starts vibing with the friend. They fall out—obviously been up too long.


She—Skittlez—turns to me and says:
“You can chill in the other room if you need to plug in or work on stuff.”


That was my cue. I set up, get my gear going. She walks in a bit later, says she’s gonna shower. But she lingers. Door open. Coming in and out. Sitting. Half-hanging. Like she was waiting for something to be said.


I shoot my shot:
“You want some company?”


She hits me with, “I have a boyfriend.” Soft tone, not quite a rejection—more like she was waiting to be convinced. I played it light.


“I give good back rubs.”


Her reply?
“You had me at back rub.”


Boom. That could’ve been a movie moment, but I blew it. Got too high. Way too high. Thought I’d knock it out the park, ended up striking out before I left the dugout. Couldn’t perform. She never let me forget it.


[Scene 2: Below the Dog on the Hierarchy Board]
Now, for context—you gotta know, I’ve got women up and down Cali I vibe with. Not like I’m runnin’ game—I’m not that dude. On the hierarchy scale, I rank below the dog. I’m not calling the shots. I’m the sidekick, the help, the fallback plan.


Skittlez? She was no different... but also, she was different. She had this need—not just for the high, but for the ritual. If the stars didn’t align—if I couldn’t get the red mushroom cloud to appear, if the vibrator was dead—it was a waste. No point even trying.


Pressure doesn’t even begin to cover it. If I couldn’t make it happen, the whole day—all my effort—felt like a bust. She never blamed me outright—but that’s the weight I carried. I knew the unspoken contract. Too much pressure. I was walking a tightrope with a 50-lb pack strapped to my back. Most dudes will never know that weight.


[Scene 3: When Her Man Was About to Get Out]
So the time came when her man was close to being released, the vibe flipped. She’d go cold. One time, right in the middle of our moment, she hit me with:
“Get out.”
I was like, “What? Now?”
She said it again: “Get. Out.”


That cut deep. One minute I’m the source of her peace, her release—the next, I’m a ghost.
But I respected her for it because she was doing the right thing.


[Scene 4: Through the Fire]
Still, I showed up for her. I always did.


She called me late one night from Montecito, scared:
“I think there’s someone outside my tent.”
I had no bike, no ride, no nothing. I ran, jogged, power-walked my way to her—from Goleta to Montecito—just because she said she needed me.
Fast forward 6 months, I was in L.A. 
She sent one text:
“I need you ASAP.”


Didn’t need more words.


I had no cash, no bus pass. My options were:


1. Beg a ride to union station from a bus driver and gamble getting a bus from Union Station—maybe find a kind soul, maybe not.


“My friend said she needed me”


2. Or get on a bus from Santa Monica to Malibu, and walk from there.


No bus, nothing going north from Malibu 


I chose option 2. Walked from Malibu to Oxnard. Took me all day, 16 hrs to be exacr. By the time I saw Point Mugu in the distance, I was running on fumes. But I kept chanting to myself:
One more rep. One more step. Let’s go.
(Literally for 2 hours I kept saying to myself, “I can’t walk any further… okay, one more step.”)


“My friend said she needed me.”


People would ask me, “Why would you do that?”


“Because I said I’d be there, that’s why.”


She got hospitalized in L.A.? I was in Santa Barbara. I dropped everything, hauled down there just so she wouldn’t feel alone. Broke my collarbone on the way, rode half the distance on a pedal bike with a completely broken collarbone. My lips were quivering the pain was so bad. Didn’t matter.


[Epilogue: The Truth Beneath It All]
It’s a complicated thing—being the one they trust, but not the one they choose. Being the safety net but never the sky. I’ve been that to so many women. But with Skittlez? The stakes felt higher. The bond, deeper.


Not love in the traditional sense.
Not friendship, either.
More like trauma twins navigating the chaos.
More like she’s the only one who ever saw all of me—and didn’t flinch.
Even when she sent me away… she knew I’d still come back.
